It is essentially a collection of topics on machine learning and last year we had 8 topics offered by various members of the department https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2122/R255/

 
It is a reading style course, so it is based on the discussion sessions typically covering research papers that students study and present to the group.

Each student has to do 3 topics, of which 2 are for attendance and active participation (amounting to 5% of the total mark each), and 1 topic for which they are assessed in more detail by:

 

* picking a research paper selected by the lecturer of the topic and presenting its content by critically analysing it to the class (20% of the total mark)

* carrying out a mini research project for the unit of coursework (70% of the total mark)



The mini project can take on a number of forms. Here are some typical ways:

 

a) Replication of a research paper(s) with experimentation and analysis of results with original and alternative/combined parameters/inputs/methods

b) Rational reconstruction (analytical literature review/survey) of a research area 

c) A detailed research proposal with some ground work already accomplished

d) A hybrid of the above

Word limit is 4000 words.

 

The delivery of R255 topic is in the format of 5 contact hours plus introductory pitching session:

 

* topic pitching session at the end of November: a 4 minute recorded video by the lecturer introducing the material covered in the topic

* session 1: open to all students on R255; general lecture style introduction to the topic

* sessions 2, 3, 4, 5: open to only students assessed and attending the topic; student presentations of paper selected by the lecturer

 

The structure of the course means that typically each topic, so each lecturer, will get around 4 students to set the coursework for, and assess student presentations. In the class there will also typically be around 8 other student actively participating (reading the papers, asking questions) and thus earning their 5% of the R255 total mark. 
This means that the workload is light for each lecturer of the topic.
