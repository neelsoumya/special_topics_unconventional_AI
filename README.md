# special_topics_unconventional_AI


## Introduction

A reading list for a special topics class (R255) at the Computer Science and Technology Department at the University of Cambridge. This is part of Advanced Topics in Machine Learning.

The title of the course is: 

`Unconventional approaches in AI: complex systems perspectives, cognitive psychology, social sciences, computational models of creativity, explainable AI inspired by other disciplines and other unconventional models`

This is AI or classical AI before big data. The time is now ripe to revisit these wonderful ideas and think about how to incorporate them in modern AI/deep learning. Insights from the past can inform future approaches to AI, especially in the age of big data.

Looking at the heritage of computing and its interdisciplinary past can inspire new approaches for the future. We need to learn lessons from the history of AI, what approaches worked and did not work in the past and how AI went through multiple `winters`.
	
These approaches can be used to develop techniques that can inspire explainable AI.

### Presentations on selected papers

Present and lead a discussion on one of these papers (or any other related paper: come speak with me).
The idea is that you raise some interesting questions. This course is meant to teach you research skills (like thinking critically about a paper and literature review skills).

### Writeup

In this course, each student would chose one paper. They would then do a presentation on it. 

Towards the end of the term they would do a writeup/short report: 

* on this paper, and 

* the topic in general (unconventional AI). They would do a literature review of other papers in the field. 

* They will then reflect/write on how these techniques can be incorporated in modern AI/deep learning. 

The intention is for students to learn how to read papers, and compare and contrast them to other papers and then evaluate what this means for AI/deep learning.

Some writing prompts for the writeup are here:

* Short report (less than 4000 words). The idea is write a coherent narrative. 

* Suggest how these ideas can be incorporated in modern AI/deep learning systems

* Why do you think these ideas were not successful in the 1950s/1960s?

* What kind of data would we need to ensure these techniques would work today?

* What lessons can we learn from the history of AI, what approaches worked and did not work in the past?

* What could be the disadvantages of these approaches?

* Rational reconstruction (analytical literature review/survey) of a research area 


Other thoughts on the writeup:

* A detailed research proposal with some ground work already accomplished

* A hybrid of all of the above


Thoughts on a project:

* If you feel ambitious, you can do a coding project based on open source data (talk to me if you would like to do this).
